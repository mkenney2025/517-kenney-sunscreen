# Understanding Sunscreen
Sun protection is important for preventing sun poisoning, blistering, irritation, and skin cancer from UV rays.

### Guiding Questions to Find the Right Sunscreen For You
1. How easily do you get sunburnt during the day?
2. How sensitive are your eyes to sunscreen exposure?
3. How often do you have time for reapplying throughout the day?
4. How much time do you spend outdoors or near a bright window?

## Mineral Sunscreen
Mineral sunscreens work by creating a protective layer on the skin’s surface that reflects UV rays off the skin.

Mineral sunscreens typically leave a white cast, or a dried-down layer of white mineral on the skin. This occurs because the white cast is the protective barrier between your skin and the sun. While it provides a visual indicator of how the sunscreen degrades throughout the day, making it more difficult to work with for everyday use, especially on the face. Some sunscreens add pigment powder to mask the white cast with varying success, especially for mineral sunscreens for deeper skin tones.

Below is an example of a mineral sunscreen. As discussed above, this product by CeraVe uses pigment powders to mask the white cast that comes with using mineral sunscreens. However, there are only 3 shades in the tints, so the shade range is still not considered accessible for all people.

### What to look for on the label:
* titaniam dioxide
* zinc dioxide
## Chemical Sunscreen
Chemical sunscreens do not reflect UV rays off the sunscreen, but instead absorb the UV rays before they reach your skin’s surface. 

Below is an example of a chemical sunscreen primer designed for skin protection under makeup. The products formulation allows for SPF 30 sun protection while blurring the skin under foundation.

Most chemical sunscreens do not leave a white cast, and are most commonly found in the form of spray bottles, skint tints and makeup primers, and stick formulas. As a result, they are more accessible for use under makeup and on wider skin tone ranges

### What to look for on the label:
* oxybenzone
* octinoxate
* cinozate
* dioxybenzone
* ensulizole
* homosalate
* octisalate
* octocrylene
* sulisbenzone
* avobenzone
* meradimate

## Notes
Expiration dates for Chemical sunscreens usually are three years past its manufacturing date, per FDA regulations. Sunscreen’s protection quality degrades after this point.

If you experience irritation while using a sunscreen, you might be allergic to one of these active ingredients. When working with chemical sunscreens, it is also possible the active ingredients may react with other skincare products you may use. Speak with your dermatologist to navigate your skin’s needs in this area.
